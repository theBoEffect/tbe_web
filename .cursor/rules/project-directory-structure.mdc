# Rule: Project Directory Structure
description: >
  Documents the main project directory structure, their purposes, and relationships.

project_root:
  directories:
    .cursor:
      purpose: "Contains IDE-specific rules and configurations"
      contents:
        - rules/: "Directory containing project-specific documentation and conventions"

    archive:
      purpose: "Contains an older version of the site and should be ignored - will eventually be deleted"
      conventions:
        - "Never examine or update anything in this directory, the contents are not related to the project"
    
    src:
      purpose: "Contains all source code for the static site"
      scope: "All Svelte components, styles, and application logic"
      conventions:
        - "Components should be in PascalCase"
        - "Utility functions should be in camelCase"
        - "Each component should have its own directory if it requires multiple files"
      contents:
        routes/:
          purpose: "Contains all page and layout components following SvelteKit's file-based routing"
          scope: "All routes, layouts, and page components"
          conventions:
            - "+page.svelte files define page content"
            - "+page.js/.ts files define page data loading and prerendering"
            - "+layout.svelte files define shared layouts"
            - "Nested directories create nested routes"
            - "Square brackets [param] for dynamic routes"
            - "Group related routes in subdirectories"
          examples:
            - "/routes/+page.svelte → /"
            - "/routes/about/+page.svelte → /about"
            - "/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte → /blog/:slug"
            - "/routes/+layout.svelte → shared layout"
    
    static:
      purpose: "Contains static assets that will be copied to the build output"
      scope: "Static files like images, favicon, and other assets"
      relationship: "Files here are copied directly to the build root"
      conventions:
        - "Files here are served at the root path (/)"
        - "Keep files organized in subdirectories if needed"
        - "Optimize assets before adding them here"
    
    docs:
      purpose: "BUILD OUTPUT ONLY - Directory for the compiled static site"
      scope: "Contains only the built static files that will be served through GitHub Pages"
      relationship: "Receives compiled output from src directory - DO NOT ADD FILES MANUALLY"
      conventions:
        - "⚠️ NEVER add or modify files directly in this directory"
        - "⚠️ All contents should be generated through the build process only"
        - "All files here are production-ready and optimized"
        - "This directory is git-tracked for GitHub Pages deployment"
        - "Contents are overwritten on each build"

conventions:
  general:
    - "Use TypeScript for type safety"
    - "Use Tailwind CSS for styling"
    - "Follow Svelte's official best practices"
    - "Keep components small and focused"
    - "Maintain clear separation between UI components and business logic"
  routing:
    - "Follow SvelteKit's file-based routing conventions"
    - "Use +page.svelte for page components"
    - "Use +layout.svelte for shared layouts"
    - "Use +page.js/.ts for page data and prerendering"

do:
  must:
    - "Place all source code in the src directory"
    - "Place all static assets in the static directory"
    - "Generate all docs directory content through builds only"
    - "Follow SvelteKit's routing conventions in src/routes"
    - "Document any new directories or major structural changes"
  avoid:
    - "NEVER add or edit files directly in docs directory"
    - "NEVER mix source code with build output"
    - "NEVER place source files outside of src directory"
    - "NEVER commit manually created files to docs directory"
    - "NEVER bypass SvelteKit's routing conventions"
