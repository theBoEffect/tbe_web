  provide reasoning, and wait for explicit approval.

when:
  language: "*"
  path: "**/*"

do:
  must:
    - "List all files to be modified"
    - "Explain specific changes required in each file"
    - "Provide rationale for each change"
    - "ensure you are recommending the least code changes possible"
    - "Wait for explicit approval before proceeding"

  - before: |
      // Multiple files changed without overview or explanation
  - after: |
      // Comprehensive list and explanation of changes submitted for review before implementation
