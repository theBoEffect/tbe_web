# Rule: File Movement
description: >
  When you need to move a file, ensure that you use system file operations for moving files, preserving history, and updating references accordingly, rather than attempting to create a new file that you then re-enter code into from memory.

do:
  must:
    - "Use system commands like `mv` or `cp` for moving or copying files"
    - "Verify the source file exists before moving"
    - "Update all related imports and references after moving files"
    - "Preserve file history by preferring move operations over create-and-delete"
    - "Check for similar functionality before creating new files"
  avoid:
    - "creating a brand new file and attempting to recreate the code from memory"
