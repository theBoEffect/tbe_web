# Rule: Directory Documentation
description: >
  When a new directory is created (except `./.cursor` directories), prompt to add documentation
  describing the directory's purpose, scope, relationships, file types, and conventions as a new cursor IDE rule under ./.cursor/rules/the-new-directory-rule.mdc

do:
  must:
    - "Prompt for a new rule documenting:"
    - " - Directory's purpose and scope"
    - " - Relationship to other directories"
    - " - Types of files/code it contains"
    - " - Any patterns or conventions used"
    - "create the rule under ./.cursor/rules as a .mdc cursor IDE file"
  avoid:
    - "Creating undocumented directories that contribute to sprawl"

example:
  - before: |
      // New directory added without documentation
  - after: |
      // Documentation rule created describing the directory's role and usage
