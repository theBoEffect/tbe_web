      <description>Hello and Welcome Once upon a time, I did quite a lot of work with wordpress websites. I had many of my own and I created them for others. Then I found the wonders of Node.js, microservice design, docker, kubernetes and so on and I didn&amp;rsquo;t look back. Unfortunately the one site that I probably should have converted was my main theBoEffect site. Well today I finally have! I can now say that I no longer support any WordPress implementations.</description>
