In my career, I am an experienced technologist, leader and developer in the IT industry with expertise in software architecture, development, quality management, micro-service implementation, event-driven architectures, commercial product development, enterprise agile implementation, and the directing and management of large organizations. In short, I build software products at scale. In my life, I am an explorer of ideas, science, art and philosophy. I exercise to stay sharp and drink way too much coffee (though I think the science is in my favor in terms of my consumption). I find that the more of life you experience, the easier it is to find the patterns that helps us innovate. So I play music, I paint, I read everything from Karl Marx to Frank Herbert to Hawking and back, and I try to always keep an open mind."
