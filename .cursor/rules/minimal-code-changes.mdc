# Rule: Minimal Code Changes
description: >
  Always analyze existing codebase and make the smallest possible changes to achieve goals,
  avoiding unnecessary refactoring, duplication, or creating new components when possible.

do:
  prefer:
    - "Analyze existing code to understand available functionality before making changes"
    - "Identify the minimal code modification that achieves the goal"
    - "Avoid refactoring unrelated code"
    - "Choose the approach that touches the least code"
    - "Never duplicate functionality already implemented"
